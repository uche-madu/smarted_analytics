    description: >
      This table provides a comprehensive summary of student performance with data organized per student, term,
      and academic year. Each row represents a unique student’s performance across multiple subjects for a given
      term within a specific academic year. The table includes student demographics, subject-specific scores,
      attendance records, teacher qualifications, and socio-economic and engagement details for parents. This
      structure allows for detailed longitudinal analyses of student progress and performance trends over time,
      supporting use cases such as term-by-term comparison, year-over-year academic growth tracking, teacher impact
      evaluation on student outcomes, and correlation analyses between parent engagement and student performance.
